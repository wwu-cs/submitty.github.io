### Manage Your Homework Library

In the library management page, you can upload new gradeables 
by multiple means, such as in one large .zip file, by a file 
path, or from a Git repo. 

To access this page, the user should choose "Homework Library" 
from the left sidebar, and then select the "Manage Libraries" 
button at the top right of the Homework Library page. 

_NOTE: This is a feature reserved for users with admin priveleges._

### Uploading Gradeables

There are three ways of uploading new gradeables in the homework 
library manager: by .zip file, by file path, or by Git repo.

**_Upload by Zip File_** To upload a gradeable through a zipped 
file, the "Upload" tab should first be selected. This tab is 
selected by default when the Library Manager page is first opened. 
    
When uploading using a .zip file, the gradeable should be inside 
of a folder,and that folder should be located in the root directory 
of the zipped file. You can include multiple gradeables inside one 
upload, as long as it doesn't exceed the maximum upload size of 
10MB. An example of the upload page can be seen in the image above.

**_Upload by File Path:_** When the instructor selects the "File 
Path" tab, there will be a text box where a file path to a location 
on the server can be entered. Hitting "Submit" will add any 
gradeables stored at this file path to the library.

**_Upload by Git Repository:_** When the instructor selects the 
"Git" tab, there will be a text box where a Git repo URL can be 
entered. Hitting "Submit" will add any gradeables kept in the 
specified git repo.

### Existing Source Management

The last tab, "View All", is for managing previously uploaded 
gradeables. You can choose to search the list, delete gradeables, 
or, in the case of gradeables uploaded by file path or Git URL, 
refresh gradeables. By choosing to refresh a gradeable, the file 
path or Git repo will be checked for changes, and the exiting 
gradeables will be replaced with the more current ones.
